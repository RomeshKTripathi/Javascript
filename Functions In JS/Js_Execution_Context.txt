GLOBAL execution context
FUNCTION/AL execution context

EVAL execution context (Optional)


Execution : 
Step 1 :
    Global Execution | Environment-
        Global Environment assigned to 'this'

Step 2 : 
    Memory Creation phase | Creation phase-
        i. memory assigned to variables but value is undefined
        ii. function defination
        Everything happens line by line

Step 3 :
    Execution Phase-
        i. values assigned to variables 
        ii. when a functions return value is assigned to a variable then 
            a new executional context is created for that particular function
            memory creation  + execution phase happens for that functional context
                i. memory assigned to memory but value is undefined
                ii. functional defination if any
                iii. values assigned to variables
                iv. value calculated and returned on demand.
        iii. Everything else executed.
        
        Functional execution context is deleted after execution.
